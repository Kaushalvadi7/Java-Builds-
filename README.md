[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

This repository is a deep dive into Java programming, covering a wide spectrum of topics from core fundamentals to advanced application development. It meticulously documents the journey of mastering Java, encompassing essential concepts like object-oriented programming, collection frameworks, stream APIs, and lambda expressions, culminating in the creation of practical mini-projects.  

## üåü Core Concepts Explored

* **Java Foundations:**
    * Comprehensive understanding of Java setup, including JVM, JRE, and JDK.
    * Proficiency in variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
    * Robust error handling techniques using `try-catch-finally` and custom exceptions.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs):**
    * In-depth exploration of classes, objects, constructors, and the `this` keyword.
    * Implementation of inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical) and polymorphism (method overloading, overriding).
    * Mastery of abstraction and encapsulation through abstract classes, interfaces, and access modifiers.
    * Utilization of static and nested classes for efficient code organization.
* **Collection Framework:**
    * Extensive use of Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList), Sets (HashSet, TreeSet), and Maps (HashMap).
    * Implementation of sorting and comparison using `Comparator` and `Comparable`.
    * Utilization of Queues (PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque) and Iterators (Iterator, ListIterator).
    * Application of generics and custom collections for type-safe and flexible data structures.
* **Stream APIs and Lambda Expressions:**
    * Proficient use of Stream APIs for data processing and manipulation.
    * Implementation of intermediate operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
    * Utilization of the `Optional` class for handling potential null values.
    * Application of parallel streams and method references for optimized performance.
    * Implementation of functional interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Supplier) and lambda expressions for concise and efficient code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights

This repository features several mini-projects that demonstrate the practical application of the learned concepts:

* **Banking Application (Basic):**
    * Implements fundamental banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
* **Library Management System (OOPs):**
    * Manages book issues and returns, and provides search functionality.
* **Employee Management System:**
    * Performs CRUD operations with sorting and filtering capabilities.
* **E-commerce Product Filter:**
    * Filters and sorts products based on various criteria.

## üí° Usage

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning resource and reference for Java development. It can be used for:

* **Educational Purposes:** Understanding and reinforcing Java concepts.
* **Practical Examples:** Providing code snippets for common Java tasks.
* **Project Templates:** Serving as a foundation for building Java applications.
